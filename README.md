# Rust Test Assignment

This repository contains three completed tasks written in Rust.

## Project Structure

```
.
├── task1    # CLI application for text file analysis
├── task2    # WebSocket API for book management
└── task3    # Multi-threaded matrix multiplication
```

Each directory is a separate Rust project with its own `Cargo.toml`, source code, and a `README.md` file describing the specific task.

## Running the Projects

To build and run each task, use:

```sh
cd taskX  # Replace X with the task number
cargo run -- <arguments>
```

For more details, refer to the `README.md` inside each task directory.

## Task Overview

### Task 1: CLI Text Analyzer
A simple CLI application that takes a file path as input and counts the number of words, lines, and characters.

### Task 2: WebSocket API for Books
A WebSocket-based server that implements CRUD operations for managing books.

### Task 3: Parallel Matrix Multiplication
